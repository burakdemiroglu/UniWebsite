By 1970, it evolved into the Eskişehir State Engineering-Architecture Academy. Following the educational restructuring in Eskişehir in 1983, it became part of Anadolu University as the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture. In 1993, a significant portion of the faculty, including staff and resources, transitioned to Eskişehir Osmangazi University by decree. However, the Faculty of Engineering resumed its educational endeavors in the 1994-1995 academic year with three departments, operating from various buildings on Yunus Emre Campus until 1998. Since October 1998, it has operated from its own buildings on İki Eylül Campus. In 2012, the Department of Architecture separated to form the Faculty of Architecture and Design, prompting the name change to "Faculty of Engineering." Currently, the Faculty of Engineering is under the auspices of Eskişehir Technical University, established by Law No. 7141 on May 18, 2018.</td>
